# 🖥 TermBoard

So I wanted a quick, colourful way to see my system stats right from the terminal –  
and maybe flex my GitHub stars at the same time, pfffft.  

So here’s **TermBoard** - a mini dev dashboard that shows:

- CPU usage
- Memory stats
- Network traffic
- Your total GitHub stars ⭐
- A nice little clock

All in a slick terminal UI built with [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich).
